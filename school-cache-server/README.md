# School Cache Server

## Overview
The School Cache Server is a Dockerized application that allows students on a Local Area Network (LAN) to download various types of content, such as software, videos, and documents, from an on-premise server. This setup reduces internet bandwidth usage and provides faster access to educational resources.

## Setup Instructions
1. **Clone the Repository**
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd school-cache-server
   ```

2. **Create Resource Folders**
   Ensure that the `resources/software`, `resources/videos`, and `resources/documents` folders exist. You can add your files to these directories.

3. **Build and Run the Docker Container**
   Use Docker Compose to build and run the application:
   ```bash
   docker-compose up --build
   ```

## Usage Instructions
- Access the School Cache Server by navigating to `http://localhost:8080/resources` in your web browser.
- You will see an auto-indexed view of the available resources in the `software`, `videos`, and `documents` folders.

## Log Access Instructions
- Access and error logs generated by Nginx can be found in the `nginx-logs` directory.
- The logs are formatted for readability, making it easier to monitor server activity.

## Development with GitHub Codespaces
This project is configured to work seamlessly with GitHub Codespaces or GitHub Dev. The `.devcontainer/devcontainer.json` file enables Docker Compose support, allowing you to run the application in a development environment directly from your browser.

## Notes
- Ensure Docker is installed and running on your machine.
- Modify the Nginx configuration in `nginx/nginx.conf` as needed to suit your requirements.
